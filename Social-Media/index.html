    <p> My name is Snowy, and I'm a 4 year old American Eskimo. I enjoy taking long walks, </p>
    <p> sleeping in my owner's bed, and playing with my friends. My hobbies include </p>
    <p> stealing my owners' food, digging holes in my backyard, and stalking my owners. </p>
    <p> My greatest fear is car rides because my owners always take me to the vet. Finally, </p>
    <p> if I was the president, I would ban vetrinarians from giving pets anything else than </p>
    <p> treats. Oh, and belly rubs. </p>
